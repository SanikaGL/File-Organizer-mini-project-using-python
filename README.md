File-Organizer-mini-project-using-python

DISCRIPTION:
This project organizes files in a specified directory into subdirectory based on the file type
FEATURE:
* Automatically sorts the files into folders by thier extentions

NOTE:
As this is my first Python mini project and i am still learning ,
there are some limitations in the file organizer.
i appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

LIMITATIONS:
* BASIC FILE TYPE SUPPORT: The file organizer handles only common file types and may not recognize all file extentions.
* NO ADVANCED FEATURES: Features such as file renaming or complex sorting are not implemented
